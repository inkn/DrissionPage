## ‚úÖÔ∏èÔ∏è Encoding Strategy

By pressing `F12`, you can see that each movie's information is contained within the `<dd>` element. Therefore, you can retrieve all `<dd>` elements in batches, iterating through them and obtaining the information for each movie.

## ‚úÖÔ∏èÔ∏è Example Code

The following code can be directly executed.

Note that a recorder object is used here. For more details, refer to [DataRecorder](http://g1879.gitee.io/datarecorder).

```python
from DrissionPage import ChromiumPage
from DataRecorder import Recorder

# Create page object
page = ChromiumPage()
# Create recorder object
recorder = Recorder('data.csv')
# Access web page
page.get('https://www.maoyan.com/board/4')

while True:
    # Iterate through all dd elements on the page
    for mov in page.eles('t:dd'):
        # Get the required information
        num = mov('t:i').text
        score = mov('.score').text
        title = mov('@data-act=boarditem-click').attr('title')
        star = mov('.star').text
        time = mov('.releasetime').text
        # Write to the recorder
        recorder.add_data((num, title, star, time, score))

    # Get the next page button, if it exists, click it
    btn = page('‰∏ã‰∏ÄÈ°µ', timeout=2)
    if btn:
        btn.click()
        page.wait.load_start()
    # Exit the program if it doesn't exist
    else:
        break

recorder.record()
