# ‚ú®Ô∏è Overview

DrissionPage is a web automation tool based on Python.

It can control browsers, send and receive data packets, and combine the two.

It combines the ease of browser automation with the efficiency of requests.

It is powerful, with numerous user-friendly designs and convenient features.

Its syntax is simple and elegant, with less code and beginner-friendly.

# üìï Background

When using requests for data collection and facing websites that require logging in, analyzing data packets and JS source code, constructing complex requests, and dealing with anti-crawling methods such as captchas, JS obfuscation, and signature parameters, the threshold is high and the development efficiency is not high. 
Using a browser can bypass many of these obstacles, but the efficiency of browser operation is not high.

Therefore, the original intention of this library is to merge them and achieve both "write fast" and "run fast". It can switch to the corresponding mode when needed, and provide a user-friendly usage method to improve development and running efficiency. 
In addition to merging the two, this library encapsulates common functions on a webpage basis, providing very convenient operations and statements, allowing users to reduce consideration of details and focus on functionality implementation. By implementing powerful functions in a simple way, the code becomes more elegant.

Previous versions were implemented by re-encapsulating selenium. From version 3.0 onwards, the author started from scratch, redeveloped the underlying framework, broke free from the dependence on selenium, enhanced functionality, and improved runtime efficiency.

# ‚òÄÔ∏è Features and Highlights

After long-term practice and countless trials, the author has summarized the experience and written them all into this library.

## üéá Powerful self-developed engine

This library adopts a self-developed engine, with built-in numerous practical functions, and has the following advantages compared to selenium by integrating and optimizing common functions:

- No webdriver characteristics

- No need to download different drivers for different versions of browsers

- Faster runtime speed

- Can search for elements across `<iframe>` without having to switch in and out

- Treats `<iframe>` as regular elements, allowing direct element search within them for clearer logic

- Can operate on multiple tabs in the browser simultaneously, even if the tabs are inactive, without the need to switch

- Can directly read browser cache to save images without needing to click "Save As" using GUI

- Can take screenshots of the entire webpage, including portions outside the viewport (supported by versions 90 and above)

- Can handle non-`open` status shadow-root

## üéá Highlighted features

In addition to the above advantages, this library also includes numerous user-friendly designs.

- Minimalistic syntax rules. Integrates many common functions, leading to more elegant code

- Easier element locating with more powerful and stable functionality

- Ubiquitous waiting and automatic retry functions. Makes unstable networks easier to control, providing program stability and peace of mind in writing code

- Provides powerful download tools. Allows for quick and reliable downloads when operating on the browser

- Allows reuse of already open browsers. No need to start the browser from scratch every time, making debugging extremely convenient

- Saves common configurations in ini files and automatically calls them, providing convenient settings and avoiding complex configuration settings

- Uses built-in lxml as the parsing engine, significantly improving parsing speed

- Wrapped in POM (Page Object Model) pattern, can be directly used for testing and easy to extend

- Highly integrated convenient functionalities, demonstrating excellence in every detail.

- There are many details that are not listed here, welcome to experience them in actual use:Ôºâ
